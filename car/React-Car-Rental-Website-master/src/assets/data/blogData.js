    " Get plenty of sleep before your drive-Think about exhaustion before you begin your journey, not after. Get at least seven hours of sleep for two consecutive nights before the road trip to build up your energy reserves. It’s best to start in the morning after a good night’s sleep, not after a long, tiring day of work (unless you plan to stop). Take regular breaks along the way to stay fresh and alert, stopping roughly every 100 miles or two hours. “Also, try to avoid driving between 1 and 3 p.m., when the body’s temperature is lower and people are naturally drowsy,” says The Sleep Doctor, Dr. Michael Breus. Bring healthy road trip snacks-Carrying along a variety of vitamin-packed, healthy foods will allow you to get by on smaller snacks throughout the long drive, while skipping the fast-food stops. “To stay alert, carrots and almonds are my favorite,” says blogger and travel expert Gretchen Breuner author of The RoadScholarz: Lessons from the Scenic Route. Stay hydrated-Keep the water supply well-stocked for maximum energy. “A possible downside of this, of course, is that you’ll need to make more bathroom stops,” says Breuner, who traveled to 19 states with her family in an RV in three months. To learn more about what to bring on a road trip, check out this list of essential items and tools to keep in your car.4. Plan your rest stops-One of the most crucial tips for road trips is to get out of your car and stretch your legs every two hours or so, our experts suggest. Plan these stops into your long drive, whether they fall at mealtimes or can be timed to let you view interesting places.",

    "Maybe you’ve noticed signs that your battery is dying but haven't had time to resolve the issue. If your battery fails to charge while driving, but the alternator is functioning properly, the car may continue running while in transit. However, you may not be able to start your vehicle after it's powered off. But if the alternator isn't functioning properly and the battery dies, your car may eventually lose power and stall or completely shut off. So, can your battery die while the car is running? Absolutely. And oftentimes, this issue is caused by a combination of alternator and battery problems.If you notice any of the symptoms mentioned above (i.e., illuminated battery warning light, reduced power to accessories, etc.), or if you're wondering what to do if your car battery dies while driving, the solution is simple. Stop by your nearest Tires Plus for car battery checks and service to prevent any potential breakdowns further down the road.Like the batteries in your smartphone, a car battery that's running all the time without being recharged may die quickly. The alternator helps to mitigate this issue by generating electricity that recharges the battery while your vehicle is running. However, the battery must be able to maintain the power that the alternator supplies first for these components to work in unison. Their combined function is why you can drive all night with headlights on with no ill effect on the battery. ",
