        The place I normally go was really busy, so I just searched for safety and emissions on google and 
        they came up with great reviews. I went there and was very surprised at how pleasant and ready to help
         they were. Lots of car places aren’t very personable, and I think that’s why it was so surprising.
          It was cheaper than the other place as well. I’m definitely going back

           Thank you so much for all the wonderful support & services.
           It was an absolute pleasure to work with you. Affordable pricing, and quick service. I had my A/C 
           serviced in about 45 minutes while I waited and now the summer heat is tolerable. Great people, great 
           service!

        “I took my truck in for some front end work and it was fixed the next day. The staff was very professional
         and friendly. The price was pretty much what you’d expect, but it is worth it for the peace of mind.
         They back their work with a great warranty. I would recommend Certified Auto Repair”

        I have taken several cars there to get fixed over the years and every time I’ve gone there they 
        have been great to work with. They only fix what needs to be fixed and don’t try and up-sell you
